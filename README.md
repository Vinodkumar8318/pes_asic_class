# Introduction
### Flow : HLL -> ALP -> Binary -> (HDL) -> GDS
#### 1. HLL -> High level language (c , c++) 
- A high-level programming language is a type of programming language that is designed to be more human-readable and user-friendly compared to low-level languages like assembly or machine code.

#### 2. ALP -> Assembly level program
- Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to the architecture of a specific computer's central processing unit (CPU). Assembly language programs are written using mnemonic codes that represent specific machine instructions which the machine can understand.

#### 3. HDL -> Hardware Description Language
- It is a specialized programming language used for designing and describing digital hardware circuits. HDLs allow engineers to model and simulate complex digital systems before physical implementation, aiding in the design and verification of integrated circuits and FPGA configurations.
- Verilog, System Verilog, VHDL

#### 4. GDS -> Graphic Data System (layout)
- Format used in the semiconductor industry to represent the layout and design of integrated circuits at a highly detailed level. GDSII files contain information about the geometric shapes, layers, masks, and other essential details that make up the physical layout of a chip.
- Tools : Klayout, Magic

##### The Hardware needs to understand what the Application software is saying it to do.This relation can be eshtablished by System Software

____System Software____
- OS : Operating System : Handles IO, memory allocation, Low level system function
- Compiler : Convert the input to hardware dependent instruction
- Assembler : Convert the instructions provided by compiler to Binary format
- HDL : A program that understands the Binary pattern and map it to a netlist
- GDS : Layout

## Introduction to Risc-v Basic Keywords
- **Instruction Set Architecture(ISA)**
  - An Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) refers to the set of instructions that a computer's central processing unit (CPU) can understand and execute. It defines the interface between software and hardware, specifying the operations that a CPU can perform, the data types it can manipulate, and the memory addressing modes it supports.

- **Risc-V ISA**
  - Risc-V ISA is an open-source ISA that has simpler and fixed length instructions that allows us to create custom processors for specific needs without being tied to proprietary architectures
 
- **Tools Used for the flow**
  - As we are aware of the flow, we will be using Risc-v ISA ALP and the RTL used will be picorv32a (We will be using rv64i during initial stages)

# Goal : Any High level Program that is written should be able to get executed in our CHIP

### List of well-known extensions present in Risc-V ISA

``` rv32i``` ``` rv64i``` ```rv32imc``` ```rv64imc``` ```rv32imafdc``` ```rv64imafdc``` ```rv32imcb``` ```rv64imcb``` ```rv32imc_sv32``` ```rv64gcv```

### Extensions and their Applications

- **I (Integer)** :The I set includes the base integer instruction set for RISC-V. It provides fundamental integer arithmetic and logical operations, data movement, and control flow instructions.
  - ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, ADDI, SLTI, JAL, BEQ, LW

- **M (Multiply and Divide)** : The M set adds integer multiplication and division instructions to the base integer set. These instructions are particularly useful for arithmetic-heavy computations.
  - MUL, MULH, DIV, REM
  
- **A (Atomic)** : The A set introduces atomic memory access instructions. These instructions enable multiple operations on memory locations to be performed atomically, ensuring that other processors or threads cannot observe intermediate states.
  - LR (Load-Reserved), SC (Store-Conditional), AMO (Atomic Memory Operation)
  
- **F (Single-Precision Floating-Point)**: The F set adds single-precision floating-point instructions. These instructions enable arithmetic operations on 32-bit floating-point numbers.

## BASICS :

Instructions that act on signed or unsigned integers are called Base Integer Instructions
There are 47 Base Integer Instructions present in RISC-V ISA

### Types of Instruction based on encoding format

1. **R-Type (Register-Type):**
   - These instructions operate on registers and have a fixed format for their operands.
   - Examples: ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, SLL, SRL, SRA, SLT, SLTU

2. **I-Type (Immediate-Type):**
   - These instructions have an immediate operand and one register operand.
   - Examples: ADDI, SLTI, SLTIU, XORI, ORI, ANDI, SLLI, SRLI, SRAI, LB, LH, LW, LBU, LHU, JALR

3. **S-Type (Store-Type):**
   - These instructions are used for storing values from registers to memory.
   - Examples: SB, SH, SW

4. **B-Type (Branch-Type):**
   - These instructions perform conditional branching based on comparisons.
   - Examples: BEQ, BNE, BLT, BGE, BLTU, BGEU

5. **U-Type (Upper Immediate-Type):**
   - These instructions have a larger immediate field for encoding larger constants.
   - Examples: LUI, AUIPC

6. **J-Type (Jump-Type):**
   - These instructions are used for unconditional jumps and function calls.
   - Examples: JAL

**[number]** represents number of bits occupied by that field

1. **Opcode [7] :** The opcode is a field within a machine language instruction that indicates the operation to be performed by the instruction. It defines the type of operation, such as arithmetic, logic, memory access, or control flow. Opcodes are used by the CPU to determine how to execute the instruction.

2. **rd (Destination Register) [5]:** The "rd" field represents the destination register in an assembly language instruction. It indicates the register where the result of the operation will be stored. After executing the instruction, the computed value will be placed in this register.

3. **rs1 (Source Register 1) [5]:** The "rs1" field represents the first source register in an assembly language instruction. It indicates the register that holds the value used in the operation. For instructions that involve two operands, "rs1" typically corresponds to the first operand.

4. **rs2 (Source Register 2) [5]:** The "rs2" field represents the second source register in an assembly language instruction. It indicates the register that holds the value used in the operation. For instructions that involve three operands, "rs2" typically corresponds to the second operand.

5. **func7 and func3 (Function Fields)[7] [3]:** These fields further refine the operation specified by the opcode. The "func7" field is used to distinguish different variations of instructions within the same opcode category. The "func3" field is used to specify a more specific operation within the opcode category. Together, these fields allow for a finer level of instruction differentiation.

6. **imm (Immediate Value):** The "imm" field represents an immediate value that is part of the instruction. Immediate values are constants that are embedded within the instruction itself. They can be used for various purposes, such as specifying offsets, constants, or small data values directly within the instruction.


#### ABI : Application Binary Interface

The instructions generated by compiler using a target ISA can be accessed by OS and User directly
- The parts of ISA accessible to User : User ISA
- The parts of ISA accessible to OS : system ISA
The access is done using Sysytem calls with the help of ABI

==> If we want to access hardware resources of processor, it has to be done via registers using ABI(names)

### ABI Names : 
- ABI names for registers serve as a standardized way to designate the purpose and usage of specific registers within a software ecosystem. These names play a critical role in maintaining compatibility, optimizing code generation, and facilitating communication between different software components.

#### Data can be stored in register by 2 methods
1. Directly store in registers
2. Store into registers from memory

To store 64 bits of data from mem to reg, we use 8*8bit stores ie., m[0],m[1]......m[7]. 

- ___RISC-V uses Little Endian format to store the data ie., Least significant Byte is stored in m[0]___

## Simulate a C program using ABI function call (using registers) and execute
